Photonix is an image hosting website to store users' images. This is the API that provides users the ability to see all images, see one image, update an image, create an image, and delete an image.  The API also provides authorization features for users to create accounts, log in, change their passwords, and log out.

#### Planning & Process

Our team started by making a list of tasks to complete in the backend.  From there, we each selected a file for which we would be responsible. There were a few bugs that needed fixing, for example, syntax based on bodyParser versus multer.  From there, we each tested CRUD features in Postman and made changes as necessary.
